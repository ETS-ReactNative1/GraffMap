# GraffMap

GraffMap is a mobile application that enables users to catalog ephemeral street art they encounter out in the wild, by taking photos on location and adding them to the database. Users can view all artwork that has been contributed by others, categorized by geolocation and displayed chronologically.

GraffMap is currently in active development and is intended as a capstone project to demonstrate completion of the curriculum for a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.
